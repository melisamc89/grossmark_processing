This is the information about what each files generates and the order they need to be run by:

1) lfp_analysis - > gruops the eeg file by shank, computes power expectrum and extract the channels con max ripple power
(analysis done in the NREM period)
1*) lfp_theta_extraction -> does the same as lfp_analysis but creates an output where the channel with max theta power in each
shank, and also saves the channel with max theta power.
(analysis done in the Maze period) (input spk and clu files)
2) spk analysis - > Groups the spk and clusters information to combine waveforms and clusters. It creates a file with the mean
waveform per cluster in each shank.
3) deep_sup_classification -> loads outputs from 1 and 2, creates figures with waveforms and spectrograms for each channel in
the shank.
It outputs a dictionary that contains the cell classification for each cluster found in each shank.
4)spikes_times_extration -> Creates a dictirionary with spikes times and classification.
inputs res file and the deep_sup_classification file.
output a dictionary that contains a list of spike times and a list of classification.
5) spikes_maze_analysis---looks for spikes that occurs during the maze and creates spike matrix
6)run deep sup analysis to create umaps and visualizations of the data in all neurons, deep and sup
